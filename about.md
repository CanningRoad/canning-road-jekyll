## What we're about

We believe in God, (the one from the Bible): Yahweh, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.

The good news is that God is **pursuing you**, because you're his treasured child. We got separated from God a long time ago by our sin (the things we've done wrong), but God desparately wants you back, like a Father who longs for his child. We are here to help you find your way back to Dad.

That's basically what it means to be an Evangelical Church - which is what we are. Hello!

We believe that God has an amazing plan for your life, for High Park, and for Southport. We meet together because we love God and we want to be part of the good things that he's doing. We are people who have been saved by Jesus and our only response is to say to him, "I want to follow you wherever you're going".

## What's the Christian faith about?

Christians talk about the "good news", but what's so good about it?

What even makes a person a "Christian"?

We wanted to answer these questions in a down-to-earth way that won't make you cringe. So we made this video; we hope you enjoy it.
